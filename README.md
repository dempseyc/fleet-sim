# fleet-sim
## gold hunt simulator to generate and intelligently manipulate data

there are 3 fleets competing, 5 different ship styles, I want a mercantile system which sets prices about ship builds.  Right now, as this is a plaything, I am testing very local to work out the game theory.

I tested the system 20 * 5sims with 'standard' ship style.  I don't see any bias coming from the code in the simulation.

## endpoints

The way I look at this, we can extrapolate ideas about markets, engineering, if we run a beautiful simulation.

## It's my own brand of gonzo game-theory!

I'll keep thinking and studying.
