# fleet-sim
## gold hunt simulator to generate and intelligently manipulate data

there are 3 fleets competing, 5 different ship styles.

I learned some statistics, standard deviation and coefficient of variance.

I tested the system 20 * 5sims with 'standard' ship style.  I don't see any bias coming from the code in the simulation.

As one adjusts the imputs, there is a not obvious change in the result.  That's where I want machine intelligence to get involved.

## endpoints

I'm forming Ideas about ecology and ecosystems, balanced, zero-sum, something to feed to a machine-brain.

## It's my own brand of gonzo game-theory!

I eventually would want an external system which sets prices for ship builds.
I'd want each fleet to have internal strategies for funding and deploying fleets.

I'll keep thinking and studying.
